## Hi, I'm Kimberly (she/her) 👋

### 🔬 About me and my Research 
- I'm a PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa. 
- My research is centered on the integration of multi-omics data, with a focus on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) as a disease model. 
- I’m passionate about developing bioinformatics tools and applying computational approaches to answer biological questions. 
- My research interests are wide-ranging — from rare diseases and multi-omics integration to tackling the reproducibility crisis in science. 
- I’m always eager to learn, explore new ideas, and contribute meaningfully to the field.

### 💻 Projects
Here are two of my recent projects that you might find interesting:
- [**Reproducibility crisis in Proteomics**](https://github.com/Kimmiecc19/reproteomics): This project tackles the reproducibility crisis in proteomics, providing scripts in both R and Python to search for available proteomics tools and compare them.
- [**RareInsight**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberly-christine-coetzer-hugo-a02049151/): A user-friendly dashboard, similar to ClinVar Miner, designed to facilitate rare disease research and data exploration.
- My PhD project **(top secret - for now)**

### 🌱 Collaboration & Interests
I’m always open to collaborations that challenge me to grow and learn. If you’re working on something that aligns with my interests in rare diseases, multi-omics, or bioinformatics, or if you have a completely new area to explore, I’d love to connect!
