## Hi, I'm Kimberly (she/her) ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸŽ“ About Me and my Research ðŸ”¬
I'm a PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at Stellenbosch University in the beautiful city of Cape Town, South Africa. My research is centered on the integration of multi-omics data, with a focus on Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) as a disease model. 
Iâ€™m passionate about developing bioinformatics tools and applying computational approaches to answer biological questions. 
My research interests are wide-ranging â€” from rare diseases and multi-omics integration to tackling the reproducibility crisis in science. 
Iâ€™m always eager to learn, explore new ideas, and contribute meaningfully to the field.

### ðŸ’» Projects
Here are two of my recent projects that you might find interesting:
- [**Reproducibility crisis in Proteomics**](https://github.com/Kimmiecc19/reproteomics): This project tackles the reproducibility crisis in proteomics, providing scripts in both R and Python to search for available proteomics tools and compare them.
- [**RareInsight**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberly-christine-coetzer-hugo-a02049151/): A user-friendly dashboard, similar to ClinVar Miner, designed to facilitate rare disease research and data exploration.
- My PhD project **(top secret)**

### ðŸŒ± Collaboration & Interests
Iâ€™m always open to collaborations that challenge me to grow and learn. If youâ€™re working on something that aligns with my interests in rare diseases, multi-omics, or bioinformatics, or if you have a completely new area to explore, Iâ€™d love to connect!
